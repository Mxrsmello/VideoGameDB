# CSE 111: Video Game Library Database Project

### Created by: Marcelo Ramirez & Marian Zuniga

## Project Overview
This video game database project is designed to manage and log detailed information about games owned by users. It functions as a personal gaming catalog, enabling users to track their gaming library, preferences, and interactions with friends. 

The database stores a range of game-specific details, including:
- Game descriptions
- User ratings
- Personal ownership records

## Key Features
- **Library Tracking**: Users can maintain a catalog of the games they own, providing a clear overview of their gaming collection.
- **Social Interaction**: Users are linked with their friends, allowing them to:
  - Share game recommendations
  - View each other's gaming activity and ratings
  - Stay informed about what games friends are currently playing
- **Game Details**: The database includes extensive information about each game, making it easy for users to explore game details and discover new favorites.
- **User Ratings and Reviews**: Users can rate games and leave reviews, fostering a shared community experience.

## Technologies Used
- **SQLite3**: A lightweight, self-contained SQL database engine that serves as the back-end database for this project.
- **SQL**: SQL queries are used to insert, update, delete, and query information from the database, supporting comprehensive data manipulation and retrieval.

## Project Structure
- **Database Tables**:
  - `Users`: Stores user information and personal details for library tracking.
  - `Friends`: Manages connections between users for social interactions.
  - `Games`: Holds core information about each game, including developer details, genres, and platforms.
  - `Ratings`: Stores user ratings for each game, enabling personalized recommendations.
  - `Owns`: Tracks ownership details for each userâ€™s gaming library.
